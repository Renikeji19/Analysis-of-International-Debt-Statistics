## INTRODUCTION 
Just like humans take debts to manage necessities. countries also take debt to manage their economies.
The World Bank provides debt to countries for them to meet needs such as providing infrastructure for citizens to live comfortably.
This project analyzes international debt data collected by The World Bank. 


## PROBLEM QUESTIONS
The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. 
The analysis provides answers to questions questions such as:

What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
Which country owes the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

## DATA PREPARATION AND PROCESSING
The dataset consists of 1 CSV file; with 2,358 rows and 5 coulumns each representing country, country code, indicator name, indicator code and debt.

## DATA ANALYSIS
The first line of code connects us to the international_debt database where the table international_debt is residing. 
To inspect the details of the world bank's international debt data, we first SELECT all of the columns from the international_debt table and limit the output to the first ten rows to keep the output clean.
